# Restaurant Reviews App 

## How to run the project

1) Clone the project.
2) In a terminal (like Git Bash, Cygwin or the Windows terminal), check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
3) With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`. You can now see the live site.
